Ever wrote code you regret? I once gave a talk about importing CSV to SQL Server at blazing speeds. The session even came with its own command, Import-CsvToSql.

The speed was addictive: 260,000 rows per second! But that speed came at the cost of reliability. Only a small number of my CSV files were perfect enough to parse. Frustrated, I found myself looking for other tools. I never used my own command, because I never expected it to work.

Countless GitHub issues later, I rewrote the entire command with a newly found focus on reliability and user-enjoyability. Join me as I highlight the issues with my old code and share what I did differently in the rewrite of what is now Import-DbaCsv.","Chrissy LeMaire","NATO Special Ops HQ","cl"

As a case study we look at Import-CSV and the Json cmdlets to see the effect on memory allocation and GC pressure. By changing the code to be allocate less, we can show significant performance improvements. We will touch on the Garbage Collector, it’s generational behavior and take a high level view of what the garbage collector needs to do. The session will introduce dotMemory – a tool to analyze the memory allocation patterns of a program, and the cost of these allocations. In the end we’ll go nuclear – Rewriting PSObject to use significantly less memory. This is achieved by taking a look at the memory layout of a PSObject, and using that knowledge to remove unnecessary sub-objects, saving on the object headers, shared lock objects, less pointer chasing etc. The beginning of this session should be easy to follow along for the more technically interested part of the community.

Come experience a technical buffet of in-the-wild malicious PowerShell payloads from 4+ years of Incident Responses & see why PowerShell’s defensive visibility is now driving many attackers away from PowerShell.
For over a decade PowerShell has empowered administrators, DevOps practitioners and automation enthusiasts to accomplish significant tasks with relative ease. However, malicious threat actors have also harnessed PowerShell’s capabilities by writing extensive offensive tools and frameworks in PowerShell.

The PowerShell team has countered these malicious trends with adding numerous defensive enhancements to PowerShell including extremely deep logging visibility (like ScriptBlock, Module and Transcription logging) as well as blocking capabilities and interfaces like the AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI).

This talk draws from over four years of Incident Response experience to lay out a technical buffet of in-the-wild malicious PowerShell payloads and techniques. In addition to diving deep into the mechanics of each malicious example, this presentation will highlight forensic artifacts, detection approaches and the deep visibility that the latest versions of PowerShell provides security practitioners to defend their organizations against the latest attacks that utilize PowerShell.

So if you are new to security or just want to learn about how attackers have used PowerShell in their attacks, then this talk is for you. If you want to see what obfuscated and multi-stage, evasive PowerShell-based attacks look like under the microscope of PowerShell deep inspection capabilities, this talk is for you.

# Introduction
We are going to look at how cloud automation, infrastructure as code can be structured and used as a software development process.
Taking a common software development approach we are going to look at each phase and see which tools can be used to accomplish each phase. The ideas are based on the lessons learned of an actual infrastructure as code project. 
		
# Abstract
This session will dive deep into the testing approach of an infrastructure as code project written in PowerShell. We will create a PowerShell module that will allow us to deploy an infrastructure as a service resource using a template. The solution will be fully tested, including unit test of functions, templates, integration and an end to end test.
 
# Tools
Leveraging tools like Pester, Script Analyzer, Best Practices Checker, Azure DevOps and custom scripts to create a mature and reliable infrastructure as code solution.

# Objectives
At the end of this talk you will be able to: 

*   create your own test suite for your infrastructure as code project. 
*  can articulate why infrastructure as code testing is necessary and can increase you quality of delivery. 
*  get started with your next infrastructure as code project quicker and much more mature.","Mark Warneke","Microsoft Deutschland","mark_mit_k_"

A lot of talks about ""Best Practice"" are aimed at showing you what you should be doing but not many take the approach of showing what you shouldn't be doing and how to change it. This can make it more difficult to grasp as it might not easily relate to how someone is currently working or has been working, showing the wrong way to do things is more approachable as everyone was a beginner at some point and many people made the same mistakes.

With recent improvements in obfuscation detection, savvy attackers have started to obfuscate less & more selectively to avoid detection. Come learn how PesterSec leverages Pester & ScriptAnalyzer to detect minimally-obfuscated PowerShell.
Over the years as attackers have increasingly used PowerShell as an important piece of their offensive toolkit, the PowerShell Team has countered by building deep inspection capabilities into PowerShell that are not found in any other scripting language. However, as defenders began using this new visibility and significantly improving their detection of malicious PowerShell usage, attackers adapted their techniques.

As attackers turned to the heavy usage of specific obfuscation techniques, like those found in Invoke-Obfuscation and Invoke-CradleCrafter, to target certain aspects of PowerShell’s ScriptBlock logging, defenders once again had to match this offensive shift with their own shift in detection methodology.

Defenders have since turned to various data science approaches, like those built into Revoke-Obfuscation, to more robustly detect heavy PowerShell obfuscation. However, countering offensive projects like PSAmsi have enabled attackers to apply selective obfuscation in minimal quantities to evade specific A/V signatures while falling under the ""obfuscation threshold"" of newer data science approaches.

Come learn how PesterSec combines the power of ScriptAnalyzer and Pester to perform context-specific detections of minimally-obfuscated PowerShell commands and scripts.

"Lessons learned from a large scale infrastructure as code project","06/07/2019 11:00","06/07/2019 12:00","Track 2","Build a solid Infrastructure as code framework using PowerShell, Az Module, Configuration Management, ARM template with Azure DevOps as a collaboration platform fully Unit and Integration tested with Pester.
# Introduction
In the last months a team of consultants have been working on a large scale big data and analytics solution. We implemented infrastructure as code framework to deploy a fully tested solution to any Azure region available with a click of a button. What used to take weeks to build can now be scripted and deployed within hours.

> By viewing cloud computing as a starting point for IT automation, companies may be able to have it all: scalability, agility, flexibility, efficiency, and cost savings. But that’s only possible by building up both automation and cloud capabilities.” McKinsey

# Abstract
This talk will highlight lessons learned implementing an infrastructure as code project from scratch working with a team. You can expect to learn what challenges to be faced when pursuing a large scale automation project on Azure and which latest technologies the team used to tackle theses challenges. 
At the end of the talk you will be able to plan ahead for your Infrastructure as Code Project. You are going to be aware of and can avoid common pitfalls in an automation project. As well as learn how to use a ""blue print"" templates approach to deploy Azure resources on demand quickly, like Windows and Linux VMs that are fully tested contentiously. Also, you will be aware of what to consider when deploying large scale solutions, that takes nearly half a day to spin up.

# Tools
We will have hands on to Azure DevOps, different Infrastructure as Code tools like PowerShell Az module, ARM templates, Unit and Integration tests with Pester. There is going to be little to no live coding, but a lot of code to show and tools to demonstrate.

# Objectives

* understand and be able to implement the best practices and pit falls the  team developed and implemented in the IaC project.
* plan and describe technologies and tools used in the field for development and automated deployments of infrastructure as code resources.
* differentiate the approaches of developing ARM template flavors and when to use them.","Mark Warneke","Microsoft Deutschland","mark_mit_k_"

"Designing a distributed flexible validation framework for Test in Prod.","06/07/2019 13:00","06/07/2019 14:00","Track 3","Not everyone loves testing in production. But, operational aspects of infrastructure begs for Tests-in-Production (TiP). This session provides insights into designing a distributed, flexible, and secure operations validations framework. Performing Operations and diagnostics validation is a very important aspect of agile infrastructure development and monitoring. While the core principle of operations and diagnostics validation is about writing tests that are used to validate the functionality of the deployed infrastructure, it is equally important to ensure that the framework that is used for operations validation is distributed, flexible, and secure by design. This session provides insights into design of one such framework and walks through the design principles while providing real-world implementation examples. This session is not just about writing Pester tests but about making it secure and efficient to run those Pester tests for infrastructure validation in the context of Test-in-Production (TiP).","Ravikanth Chaganti","PowerShell Magazine","ravikanth"
